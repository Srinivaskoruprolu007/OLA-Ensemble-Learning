# Ola Driver Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting driver churn for Ola, based on various driver attributes such as age, gender, education level, income, quarterly ratings, and total business value. The goal is to predict whether a driver will leave the company and explore the factors that contribute to their retention or churn.

### Problem Statement

The objective is to:
1. Analyze driver data to understand the factors influencing their performance and churn.
2. Predict driver churn using ensemble models.
3. Identify actionable insights that Ola can use to improve driver retention.

### Key Tasks

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Perform univariate and bi-variate analysis on key variables like Age, Income, Total Business Value, Quarterly Rating, etc.
   - Observe patterns in the categorical variables (e.g., Gender, City, Education Level).
   - Visualize the data through plots like scatter plots, box plots, and correlation heatmaps.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Detect and handle missing values using **KNN Imputation**.
   - Perform feature engineering to create new variables that could aid in prediction.
   - Address class imbalance, standardize numerical data, and encode categorical variables for machine learning models.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Use ensemble methods like bagging and boosting (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to build predictive models.

4. **Results Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model using classification metrics like the confusion matrix, ROC-AUC curve, and classification report.

## Steps Completed

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Data Loading and Initial Checks**:

  - Loaded the dataset and analyzed its shape, data types, and summary statistics.
  - Identified missing values and handled them during data preprocessing.

- **Univariate Analysis**:

  - Visualized the distributions of continuous variables like `Age`, `Income`, and `Total Business Value`.
  - Used bar plots to analyze categorical variables like `Gender`, `City`, `Education_Level`, and `Quarterly Rating`.

- **Bivariate Analysis**:
  - Created scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps to observe relationships between variables.
  - Key insights:
    - A high correlation (0.47) exists between `Total Business Value` and `Quarterly Rating`.
    - Drivers in their 30s and early 40s tend to earn the highest income.
    - Ratings are positively correlated with business value.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- **KNN Imputation**:

  - Missing values in `Age` and `Gender` were imputed using KNN Imputation.
  - Categorical columns (`Gender`, `City`, etc.) were encoded using `LabelEncoder` for machine learning.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created a binary feature `Left_Company`, indicating whether a driver has left the company.
  - Planned creation of additional features like `Quarterly Rating Increase` and `Monthly Income Increase`.

### 3. Next Steps

- **Class Imbalance Treatment**:

  - Address class imbalance using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or SMOTE.

- **Standardization & Encoding**:

  - Standardize numerical data and perform one-hot encoding for categorical variables.

- **Modeling**:
  - Build ensemble models for prediction using algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost.

- **Driver_ID**: Unique identifier for each driver.
- **Age**: Driver's age.
- **Gender**: Gender of the driver.
- **City**: City where the driver operates.
- **Education_Level**: Driver's education level.
- **Income**: Monthly income of the driver.
- **Dateofjoining**: The date when the driver joined the company.
- **LastWorkingDate**: The last date the driver worked for the company.
- **Joining Designation**: Driver's designation at the time of joining.
- **Grade**: Driver's grade within the company.
- **Total Business Value**: The total business generated by the driver.
- **Quarterly Rating**: Driver's performance rating on a quarterly basis.
